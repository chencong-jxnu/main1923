          <p class="text">Tutorial 1题目: Domain Adaptation for Neural Machine Translation</P>
          <p class="text">内容:</p>
          <p class="text">Neural machine translation (NMT) is a deep learning based approach for machine translation, which yields the state-of-the-art translation performance in scenarios where large-scale parallel corpora are available. Although
            the high-quality and domain-specific translation is crucial in the real world, domain-specific corpora are usually scarce or nonexistent, and thus vanilla NMT performs poorly in such scenarios. Domain adaptation that leverages both
            out-of-domain parallel corpora as well as monolingual corpora for in-domain translation, is very important for domain-specific translation. In this tutorial, we give a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art domain adaptation
            techniques for NMT. We hope that this tutorial will be both a starting point and a source of new ideas for researchers and engineers who are interested in domain adaptation for NMT.</p>

          <p class="text">王瑞的个人简介：</p>
          <p class="text">Rui Wang is a tenure-track researcher at NICT. His research focuses on machine translation, a classic task in NLP (or even in AI). He (as the first or the corresponding authors) has published more than 20 MT papers in
            top-tier NLP conferences and journals, such as ACL, EMNLP, COLING, AAAI, IJCAI, TASLP, TALLIP, etc. He has also won the first places on several language pairs of WMT shared tasks, such as the unsupervised Czech<->German task in 2019 and
              the supervised Finnish/Estonian<->English tasks in 2018. He served as the area co-chairs of CCL-2018/2019 and the organization co-chairs of PACLIC-29 and YCCL-2012.</p>

          <p class="text">Tutorial 2题目: Speech Translation</p>
          <p class="text">内容:</p>
          <p class="text">We will start with an overview on the different use cases and difficulties of speech translation. Due to the wide range of possible applications these systems differ in data, difficulty of the language and spontaneous
            effects. Furthermore, the interaction with human has an important influence. In the main part of the tutorial, we will review state-of-the-art methods to build speech translation system. We will start with reviewing the translation
            approach of spoken language translation, a cascade of an automatic speech recognition system and a machine translation system. We will highlight the challenges when combining both systems. Especially, techniques to adapt the system to
            scenario will be reviewed. With the success of neural models in both areas, we see a rising research interest in end-to-end speech translation. While we see promising results on this approach, international evaluation campaigns like the
            Shared Task of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) have shown that currently often cascaded systems still achieve a better translation performance. We will highlight the main challenges of end-to-end speech
            translation. In the final part of the tutorial, we will review techniques that address key challenges of speech translation, e.g. Latency, spontaneous effects, sentence segmentation and stream decoding.</p>
